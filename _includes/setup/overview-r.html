  <h3 class="well well-small">R</h3>

  <p>
    R is a programming language that specializes in statistical
    computing. It is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To
    interact with R, we will
    use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an interactive
    development environment (IDE).
  </p>

<p>
  If you already have R installed on your computer, please check
  the version. You will not be able to download all the packages we
  will use in the boot camp if you do not have R version > 2.14.1.
