  <strong>What:</strong> 
  Our goal is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
  by teaching them basic computing skills. In this two-day boot camp,
  attendees will learn basic programming, as well as best practices for
  writing correct and reproducible code, through short tutorials
  interspersed with hands-on practical exercises.
